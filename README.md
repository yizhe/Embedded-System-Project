Embedded-System-Project
=======================
This is the code for a embbede system programming class of UPenn. 
For our project, we designed a multi-robot cooperation system.

We use Pololu 3pi robots and mbed as our developping tool, the final codes are in 
three folders: 'Master', 'Slave', and 'Localization-Controller'.
The 'Localization-Module' folder is an independent localization module that 
can be used in other similar projects.
Monitor.py is a python debugging tool under linux.
